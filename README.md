Scraping Weekly Data for AL West Division


This repository uses R script to scrape weekly Al West data from baseball reference. A friend is a contributor for the Houston Astros blog and wanted to get some data for weekly write-ups. 

Look for this code to be cleaned up and more efficient in the future.
